# surfs_up
## Overview
Weather analysis to support a surf and ice cream venture in Hawaii. We will use Python, Jupyter notebook, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and VSCode dev environment for this project. 

Collect and analyze temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
The results of the analysis are displayed in the two figures below displaying statistical analysis for June temperatures and December temperatures.
While the max temperatures on record are similar for both months (85 degrees F in June versus 83 degrees F in December), there are relevant differnces between the two months:
The three key differences in weather between June and December are:
1. The mean or average temperature between June and December is slightly different. For June the mean is 74.9 (or 75 degrees), while the mean temp for December is 71 degrees.
2. The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees.
3. The 75% of temperatures in December is 74 degrees versus the 75% in June is 77 degrees.

## Summary
In addition to analysis of temperatures for June and December, we also developed statistics for precipitation in June and December as shown by the images below.
Note that, the mean precipitation in June is 0.14 inches, whereas the mean precipitation in December is 0.22 inches. However, the maximum precipitation in December is slightly over 6 inches and in June the maximum is 4.43 inches.

In conclusion, both June and December would be conducive to surfing, June may have a slight edge for expected ice cream demand due to slightly higher temps and lower maximum rainfall.
